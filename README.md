# Hello-Peeps-Discord-Bot

Its a simple Discord bot which supports some basic functions - 

1. Toonify - 
Upload an image in the disord server with the comment - "-toonify". The bot should reply with the toonified image.

Toonify is supported by -

2. Friends quotes - 
If a message on server includes either of the words - 'friends', 'Friends' or 'F.R.I.E.N.D.S' the bot should reply with one of the few quotes I have added from the sitcom friends.

3. Greet new members - 
New members should be greeted by the bot in their DMs.
